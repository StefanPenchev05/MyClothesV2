## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our project is a top priority. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our software, we encourage you to let us know as soon as possible. We welcome working with security researchers and the community to improve the security of our project.

Please follow these guidelines when reporting a vulnerability:

- **Contact**: Provide your report privately by emailing us at [penchev.stefan@icloud.com]. Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or other public forums.

- **Information to Include**: In your report, please include details that will help us to understand and reproduce the issue. This can include things like:
  - The version of our software you are using.
  - A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
  - A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (proof-of-concept scripts or screenshots can be helpful).
  - Any suggestions for how the vulnerability might be remediated.

- **Expectations**: After submitting a vulnerability report, you can expect the following:
  - We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours.
  - We will provide regular updates on our progress.
  - We will strive to resolve any confirmed vulnerabilities as quickly as possible and will work with you to agree on a public disclosure timeline.

- **Safe Harbor**: We support responsible disclosure, and we do not take legal action against individuals who report vulnerabilities in good faith. We ask that you do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason. This includes demonstrating additional risk, such as attempting unauthorized access to data, or executing or uploading malicious software.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Thank you for helping us keep our project safe.
